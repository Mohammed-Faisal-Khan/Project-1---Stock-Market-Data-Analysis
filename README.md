# Project-1---Stock-Market-Data-Analysis
The entire idea of predicting stock price is to gain significant profits.

We Have Used Below Steps To Complete Project :

1. Imported Necessary libraries
2. Imported Data
3. Data Understanding
4. Data Visualization
5. Performed Assumption Check

6. Applied Neural Network
6.1 MODEL 1 - Stacked LSTM
  6.2. MODEL 2 - Bidirectional LSTM
  6.3. MODEL 3 - GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) LSTM
  6.4. MODEL 4 : BGRU (Bidirectional GRU) LSTM

7. Data Driven Forecasting Methods
  MODEL 5 - Simple Exponential Method
  MODEL 6 - Holt Method
  MODEL 7 - Holts winter exponential smoothing with additive seasonality and additive trend
  MODEL 8 - Holts winter exponential smoothing with multiplicative seasonality and additive trend

8. Model based Forecasting Methods
  MODEL 9 - Linear Model
  MODEL 10 - Exponential Model
  MODEL 11 - Quadratic Model
  MODEL 12 - ARIMA Model

9. Future Forecasting Using LSTM
